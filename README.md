# Jedha-Steam

This is one of several projects to hand in in order to get my data science diploma. The Steam project validates the Big Data module.

The ultimate goal of this project is to understand what factors affect the popularity or sales of a video game. But our fictional boss asked us to take advantage of this opportunity to analyse the video game market globally.

## Notebook links

The project instructions ask students to include a share link for the examinators to see the graphs in DataBricks. However, it is unfortunately no longer possible to give access to anyone who has the share link, and I was told to include the pictures alongside the notebook(s). They are in the "graphs" folder. I will also include them in the notebook.\
If you are an examinator reading this and would like me to specifically give you access to the notebook on DataBricks, please get in touch, as I may be able to do so.
